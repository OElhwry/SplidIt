## The problem

Splitting a group bill takes more time than the meal that caused it. Splitwise is overkill for a one-off court hire or a single dinner. Notes-app math gets messy the moment people pre-paid different amounts. And when the booking was *time-based* — padel, tennis, hourly studio rental — equal splits feel unfair if one player only showed up for the second half.

## The solution

A pure-frontend expense splitter with **three modes**, a **minimum-transactions** settlement algorithm, and a participation-aware **time-based** split for shared activity bookings. No account, no server, no data leaving your browser unless you explicitly share. Live updates as you type, motion-rich UI, and a shareable receipt that exports as text, image, or URL.

---

## What it does

### Split modes

| Mode | What it does | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| **Equal** | Total ÷ N people | Dinners, group cabs, shared groceries |
| **Custom %** | Each person sets a percentage; live progress bar enforces 100% | Uneven contributions, weighted shares |
| **By Time** | Each person pays in proportion to minutes used vs the booking duration | Padel courts, tennis sessions, hourly rentals |

### Minimum-transactions settlement

Greedy debtor-↔-creditor matching: pairs the largest debt with the largest credit, settles the overlap, repeats. The result is the smallest possible number of transfers to leave the group square.

### Time-based participation timeline

In **By Time** mode, each person gets a touch-friendly slider (0 → session length) with quick presets — `Full · ¾ · ½ · ¼`. A visual timeline shows everyone's relative participation as colour-coded bars, plus a fairness strip showing each person's saving (or extra cost) versus a flat equal split.

### Three ways to share

| Method | Output |
|---|---|
| **Text** | Plain summary copied to clipboard — paste into any chat |
| **Image** | Branded receipt PNG via `html2canvas` (lazy-loaded; ~47KB gz, only fetched when you click) |
| **Link** | Base64-encoded state in a URL — opens with the same split for the recipient |

### Persistence

State auto-saves to `localStorage` on every change (debounced 250ms) and rehydrates on revisit. Shared URLs override saved state. A one-tap **Clear & start fresh** wipes everything (storage + URL params) without confirmation.

### Built for hands

- 22px touch-friendly slider thumbs with grab/grabbing cursors
- Mobile-first 520px-max layout, glassmorphic cards, layered radial gradients
- `:focus-visible` outlines on every interactive control
- Mode picker is a proper ARIA `tablist` with arrow-key navigation
- Sliders announce position spoken (`aria-valuetext="45m of 90m"`)
- Toast announcements use `role="status" aria-live="polite"`
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` for the count-up animations

### Repo layout

```
SplitFare/
├── docs/                          # design notes
└── split-expense-app/             # the SPA
    ├── public/

        └── main.jsx               # React entry
```

A deliberate single-file component model: all the CSS, helpers, and components live in `App.jsx` so the whole app reads top-to-bottom. ~2,200 LOC at v1.0.

### Bundle

```
dist/assets/index.js         ~120KB gz   ← React + Framer Motion + app
dist/assets/html2canvas.js    ~47KB gz   ← lazy-loaded on Image export only
```

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js ≥18
- npm

### Local dev

```bash
# 1. Install
git clone https://github.com/OElhwry/SplidIt.git
cd SplidIt/split-expense-app
npm install

# 2. Run
npm run dev      # → http://localhost:5173/SplidIt/
```

### Production build

```bash
npm run build    # → split-expense-app/dist (split into 2 chunks)
npm run preview  # local preview of the built bundle
```

The Vite config sets `base: '/SplidIt/'` so the static build deploys cleanly to GitHub Pages under `/SplidIt/`.

### Useful scripts

```bash
npm run lint     # ESLint with React-hooks + react-refresh rules
npm run build    # Production build (split: main + html2canvas)
npm run preview  # Preview the prod build locally
```

## Privacy & data

| | Stored |
|---|---|
| 🖥️ **Your device only** (`localStorage`) | The split you're working on — people, amounts, durations, mode |
| 🔗 **In a URL** *(only if you share a link)* | Base64-encoded state in `?data=...` — encrypted in transit, never sent to any server |
| ❌ **Never collected** | Account info, analytics, telemetry, cookies, third-party trackers |
| 🤝 **Third parties** | None — SplidIt talks to nothing. Static site, zero network traffic beyond the initial HTML/JS load. |

Reset state with the **Clear & start fresh** button at the bottom of the app. It clears `localStorage` and strips any `?data=...` from the URL.

## Design & tooling

| Tool | Used for |
|---|---|
| [**Framer Motion**](https://www.framer.com/motion/) | Page reveals on scroll, count-up balances, animated mode-tab indicator (`layoutId`), settled-up burst, slider springs |
| [**Lucide React**](https://lucide.dev) | All inline SVG icons (no emoji, no icon-font weight) |
| [**Inter**](https://rsms.me/inter/) · [**JetBrains Mono**](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) | Sans + tabular-numerals monospace |
| [**Coolors**](https://coolors.co) | Emerald gradient palette tuning |
| [**GitHub Pages**](https://pages.github.com) · [**Vite**](https://vitejs.dev) | Static hosting + build pipeline |

**Brand identity:** emerald `#34d399` → deep `#10b981` on a dark green-black `#060c08` canvas. Cursor-follow glow, layered radial gradients, and a soft dot-grid mask provide depth without busyness. Dark-first by design — same family resemblance as the project's portfolio page.

### Built with Claude

This project — every line of JSX, the calculation logic, the CSS, the motion choreography, the share-card design, even this README — was paired with **[Claude](https://claude.ai)** ([Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com)) using **[Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code)**. The "By Time" mode, the polish-pass that took the app from a basic form to a portfolio piece, and the engineering decisions around persistence, lazy-loading, and accessibility were all worked out in conversation. Couldn't have shipped this kind of polish solo at this pace.

## Roadmap

- [x] **MV1** — Equal + Custom % modes · settlements algorithm · text/image/link share · GitHub Pages
- [x] **v1.0** — By Time mode with timeline · emerald revamp · Framer Motion choreography · `localStorage` persistence · lazy-loaded image export · ARIA tablist mode picker · branded receipt card · first-visit pulse
- [ ] **v1.1** — Currency selector · multi-split history · keyboard shortcuts (`⌘K` palette) · per-person notes
- [ ] **v2** — Sub-splits within a single bill · saved groups · per-person discount/tax adjustments · CSV export

---

## Why it stands out

- **Time-based split** — a mode designed for the specific friction of shared activity bookings (padel, tennis, hourly courts) that no general-purpose splitter handles cleanly
- **Settlements algorithm** — minimum-transactions greedy matching, not naive pairwise transfers
- **No backend** — works offline, no signup, no telemetry, no third-party calls; everything client-side
- **Polish discipline** — count-up numbers, sliding tab indicators, `layoutId`-driven morphing, draw-in settlement arrows, springy thumbs, settled-state burst, first-visit pulse hint
- **Accessibility taken seriously** — `aria-valuetext` on sliders, `role="tablist"` mode picker with arrow-key navigation, live regions for toasts, focus-visible outlines, reduced-motion respect
- **Engineering signals** — code-split bundle (initial 120KB gz, deferred 47KB gz), debounced versioned persistence, URL-state restoration, html2canvas-safe receipt design
